<h1>SnackRun - Snake Game</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<br>SnackRun is a classic Snake Game developed in C++. The game features a snake that grows longer as it eats food, and the player must avoid running into the walls or its own body. It offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, where the speed of the game changes based on the difficulty selected.

<h2>Features</h2>

Snake Movement: Control the snake using arrow keys (W, A, S, D) to move up, left, down, and right.
Food: The snake eats food represented by an apple (üçé), which increases its length and score.
Walls and Collision: If the snake runs into the walls or its own body, the game ends.
Difficulty Levels: Three difficulty levels are available, affecting the speed of the game.
Game Restart: After a game over, you can restart the game by pressing "R".
Controls
